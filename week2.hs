{-Write a function:
sign :: Int -> Int
that returns 1 for positive arguments, -1 for negative arguments and 0 for zero-valued
arguments.-}

{-Write a function:
howManyEqual :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
which determines how many of its three arguments are equal (i.e. it returns either 0,
2 or 3).-}

howManyEqual :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
howManyEqual x y z
    | x == y && y == z = 3
    | x == z = 2
    | y == z = 2

{-Write a function:
sumDiagonalLengths :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Float
which takes the side-lengths of three squares as its arguments, and returns the sum of
the lengths of the squaresâ€™ diagonals.

{-A taxi company calculates fares based on distance travelled. Fares start at Â£2.20; 50p
is added for each kilometre covered for the first 10 kilometres; and 30p is added for
each additional kilometre. Write a function:
taxiFare :: Int -> Float
which takes the distance in kilometres, and returns the fare in pounds-}
